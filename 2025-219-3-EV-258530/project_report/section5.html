<h3>Evaluation of System Requirements</h3>

Achieved .<br>

Works as expected and runs smoothly in practice while being easy to use. In the beginning I hoped to keep all user interaction in python but as a result of the wording of AR1 and AR2 I had to integrate it into HTML. For BR3 it worked entirely flawlessly with all analytics and menus being intuitive and responsive to use and code. For the ARs however, integrating the graphs I had into a webpage proved challenging to figure out on account of my limited expertise with javascript and navigating between HTML, Java and Python through Firebase. <br>


<h3>Evaluation of End User Objectives</h3>
<p>You should consider how the project has met the needs of the end user(s) that you have referred to in section two of the report.</p>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<p>If I had more time, I would spend time learning about the most recent versions of the firebase-admin and pyrebase modules because as a result of being stuck in the outdated base Firebase, I had to adapt my IDE to use it and had to create a homemade event listener in python. This is where I feel the project could be streamlined massively. About 50 lines of finicky dictionary flattening and update checking could be mitigated by an event listener function in python that given more time, I'm sure I could've found</p>
