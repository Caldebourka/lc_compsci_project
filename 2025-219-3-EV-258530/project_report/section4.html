          <strong>Ideas:</strong><br/><br/>
          <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
            <strong>Altitude:</strong> Is the altitude of the airport proportional to the amount of bird collisions?<br/><br/>
            <strong>Make/Model of Aircraft:</strong> Do certain makes or models have more collisions? (Quieter = less?)<br/><br/>
            <strong>Radar systems:</strong> Do airports with different radar systems crash into fewer birds?<br/><br/>
            <strong>Create a bird:</strong> Use a feedback form layout in HTML for the user to pick the breed,
            airport, plane make/model and send it to Thonny through Firebase to find the chance that there will be
            a collision according to the data <br/><br/>
            <strong>Pilots:</strong> Do we need better radar? Are there fewer crashes if the pilot knew that the bird was there?<br/><br/>

<h3>Unit Testing</h3>
<p>You should explain and detail some unit testing which has taken place during the development process.<br> 
This is testing of a function within your
code - invalid values, extreme values etc.<br> 
Maybe have a test table along with it.</p>
<p>

<h3>Problems Encountered</h3>
<blockquote>
	
	<a>In Iteration 2 (I2) of my python code to clean and process the data, I encountered an issue with list indexing.
	This happened in my function <strong>topnbirds()</strong> in which my plan was to print out the top n most common
	birds in the dataset (lists already made and cleaned for use in I1). I created a temporary list<strong>(temp_s)</strong>
	to store the unsorted list of strike numbers (important that this list "s" remains unsorted to make sure each on corresponds
	to the same index number as the breed it represents in my 2 lists (lists are called "b" and "s" within the function)). 
	</a>
	<a>I then start a loop of length <strong>n</strong> that finds the largest element in <strong>temp_s</strong>, stores it 
	in a list <strong>(cmmn_lst)</strong> and then removes the value from <strong>temp_s</strong>. This way, by using <strong>b[s.index(m)]</strong>
	it will get the index position of the max value of <strong>temp_s</strong> and print the value of that index position in the list
	(essentially printing the "x"th common bird species, where it stops at the value of <strong>n</strong> that the user inputted). 
	This failed to work however because according to the error message, the value m <strong>(max value in temp_s)</strong> did not exist
	in the list <strong>s</strong>
	</a>
	
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	
	<a>
	My first port of call to iron this out was to run a quick check to see if <strong>m</strong> was in the main list <strong>s</strong> 
	at any point during the loop. Of course it outputted "no" each time, proving that I was trying to acces a list element that wasn't there at all each time.
	This confused me greatly because in my mind, the value of <strong>m</strong> was taken from an exact copy of this list so therefore 
	it should be in the main list <strong>s</strong>. I then thought that if I made that check before the .append and .remove functions, I 
	might see something different.
	</a>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	<img src="images/temp_s_check2.png" style="width:400px;">
	<a>
	Lo and behold, my check outputs yes and successfully prints the top 3 most common breed names (element in list b of the same index position 
	as the nth max value in the list s). But when I run my code, it does technically as intended (print the top n most common breeds) but there was something that I didn't foresee that 
	came up in the shell. In the dataset there are multiple entries where the breed was listed as <strong>"Unknown bird - small" or 'Unknown bird - large'</strong>
	etc. Unfortunately most of the top breeds were unknown so they had to be cleaned out to give me names of breeds I could use. My thinking was 
	that I could use a while loop instead of the for loop I was using and make a dedicated count variable. By making this variable, it 
	grants me the opportunity to add or take away loop iterations based on the incoming data ie if the breed is one of the unknowns, it
	won't append to the list or increment my count variable to make sure that n elements are in the list at the end.
	</a>

<p>An explanation of a piece of code or algorithm that was important in the development of the project. Screenshot it and explain how it works.<br> 
Again you could use multiple snippets of code.<br>
