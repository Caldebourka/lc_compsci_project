	<a><h4>Provide Insights into Wellbeing.</h4>
	During the research phase of this project, I brainstormed plenty of possible angles I could look at my core dataset with and the one I 
	liked the best was this. <strong>What effect does the bird's size or breed have on the chance it will hit a plane and therefore can we
	reduce the amount of strikes by not building airports in places where these birds are most likely to be found.</strong> By using this as my
	question, it will allow me to integrate the interactive element I had envisaged from the start (bird maker)to show to the user that there is a 
	higher probability that certain bird species will be involved in a strike (according to the dataset)
	</a>
	
	<a><h4>Initial thoughts on your own project</h4>
	All in all, as of the time of writing this (6/12/24) I am excited and inspired by this project and what will entail. Not only is my dataset of military level quality but the prospect of being able to find the probability that a bird I designed will be involved in a strike sounds really fun to find and to program. Also, aside from the fun, being able to calculate statistics like these will contribute to the safety of our citizens in the air, the maintenence of the aviation industry but also the conservation of the innocent wildlife ivolved in these strikes (looking at u 343 species of birb ;( )
